## Privacy Policy

CleanTrack does not collect, store, or share any personal information.

All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external server. The app does not use analytics, ads, or third-party services.

Although the app is built with Blazor and may internally use a WebView for rendering content, it does not load any external websites or resources. No user data is transferred through WebView or tracked.

No permissions are required beyond basic local storage for internal functionality.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [kvlv.gg@gmail.com].
